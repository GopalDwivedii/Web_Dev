    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Neural Networks are revolutionizing the world of technology. AI refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. ML is a subset of AI that focuses on enabling machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time without explicit programming. Neural Networks are a key component of ML, inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.</p>

    <p>AI, ML, and Neural Networks have applications in various fields, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and more. They can analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns, make predictions, and automate complex tasks. For example, in healthcare, AI can assist in diagnosing diseases, while ML algorithms can predict patient outcomes based on historical data.</p>

    <p>Neural Networks are composed of interconnected nodes, called neurons, that process and transmit information. They can learn from examples, recognize patterns, and make decisions. Deep Learning, a subset of ML, utilizes deep neural networks with multiple layers to extract high-level features from data.</p>

    <p>The advancements in AI, ML, and Neural Networks have led to significant breakthroughs, such as self-driving cars, voice assistants, and personalized recommendations. As technology continues to evolve, these fields will play a crucial role in shaping the future, enabling us to solve complex problems and make intelligent decisions.</p>
